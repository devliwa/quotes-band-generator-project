#### Step 1 - Make the get route work and render the index.ejs file.

#### Step 2 - Make the generate name functionality work

Hint: When the "Generate Name" button in index.ejs is clicked, it should hit up this route.

Then:

1. You should randomly pick an adjective from the const "adj" and a noun from const "noun", scroll down to see the two arrays.
   
2. Send the index.ejs as a response and add the adjective and noun to the res.render
   
3. Test to make sure that the random words display in the h1 element in index.ejs

#### Step 3 - Make the styling show up.

Hint 1: CSS files are static files!

Hint 2: The header and footer are partials.

Hint 3: Add the CSS link in header.ejs

#### Step 4 - Add a dynamic year to the footer.
Hint: Google to find out how to get the current year using JS.
